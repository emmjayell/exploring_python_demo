#Exploring Python Demo
This project contains the script used during the 10/17/24 Santa Maria Coders meeting.

## dodemo.py
dodemo reads the excel workbook, workbook.xlsx and writes out a powerpoint file

The underlying magic are two python libraries - pandas Python data analysis library and pypptx.

I have used these to automate status reports, build conceptual architecture diagrams, etc.

If there is interest, I can better document setting up the build environment.
