# Environment Setup
These are my notes from the environment setup.
System is a Ubuntu 24.04 desktop environment.
This is not set up as a script, so don't run these 
blindly, unless you know what you are doing.

## bash shell commands

sudo apt install python
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3.12-venv
python3 -m venv python312
cd python312/
cat pyvenv.cfg 
source python312/bin/activate
pip install pandas python-pptx
pip install openpyxl
pip install colordict
